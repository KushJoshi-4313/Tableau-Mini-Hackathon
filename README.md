# Tableau-Mini-Hackathon
Work with the attached dataset Superstore.xls to create a dashboard with the observations. This file has sheets related to orders of a Superstore. All the column names are self-explanatory
Your charts in the dashboard should attempt to answer questions like the following, but not limited to:
·        Which Category is Best Selling and Most Profitable?
·        What are the Best Selling and Most Profitable Sub-Category?
·        Which is the Top Selling Sub-Category?
·        Which Customer Segment is Most Profitable?
·        Which is the Preferred Ship Mode?
·        Which Region is the Most Profitable?
·        Which City has the Highest Number of Sales?
